	<H1 STYLE= "text-align: center"> Why is living off campus is better? </H1>
		<p STYLE= "text-align: center ; background-color:pink"> Overall at UGA, on campus living is great, especially for freshman. I think requiring freshman to live on campus is smart because it's a huge transition and having the convenience of everything on campus at one's disposal eases some of their stress. However, after freshman year, on campus living begins to have more cons than pros. It is way more expensive and it can keep students from experiencing living in the real world. Read on to find out more information on why off campus living is the way to go and to look at some viable options for off campus living for students.</p>
	<H2> Money </H2>
		<p STYLE= "background-color: lavender"> A misconception about living on campus is that it's cheaper. However, if one lives in an apartment style dorm, they will be paying almost $850 a month, not including furnishings or parking. It seems cheaper because it is paid in a lump sum. For $850 a month, one would be able to live in a luxury apartment in downtown Athens that comes fully furnished and has any amenity one could want. To live more modestly, one would most likely pay around $600-$700 a month which is cheaper than a lot of the dorms for upperclassmen on campus. </p>
	<H2> Holding students back </H2>
		<p STYLE= "background-color: lavender">As I said before, living on campus is great for freshman. However, after freshman year, a lot of people like to live off campus so they can start experiencing the real world and all it has to offer. One needs to learn how to pay rent and bills each month sooner rather than later. If students continue to live on campus for their college career, they will not be exposed to the real world until way after than everyone else, making them outliers in society.
